# cat=config; type=boolean; label=Enable All Programming Languages: Per default this extension only ships a small preselected subset of syntaxes (PHP, CSS, JavaScript, HTML, XML, bash, TypoScript, YAML and JSON) out of the wide variety of supported languages of prism.js. This is mainly to keep the included JavaScript as small as possible. If you check this box however, all of the supported languages will be available in the code snippet content element. This results in a bigger JavaScript file to be included!
